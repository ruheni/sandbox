This repository contains files used for learning various programming concepts in the various programming languages I'm learning

**Projects**

[**1. Notification**](https://github.com/ruheni/sandbox/tree/master/notification)

In this folder, I've explored the `Notification` Browser API used to request the user for permission and sending notifications to the user from a web application or website. They send notifications to the user in the background. No external APIs are used to send notifications to a user.

[**2. Web-Components**](https://github.com/ruheni/sandbox/tree/master/web-components) 

I explore how to make `custom HTML elements` in JavaScript and using the `Shadow DOM` and using classes to declare the elements and export them for rendering on the HTML page. `news-article.js` is the file that contains the `custom HTML element` created and used in `index.js` file to finally parse JSON and render them on `index.html`.

[**3. Testing**](https://github.com/ruheni/sandbox/tree/master/testing)

`Mocha` is used for writing and running `unit tests` in JavaScript. I use it to learn how to write tests for my work, from the basics. More tests will be coming up frequently as I create more applications to improve my skills in writing tests.

[**4. Simple REST API**](https://github.com/ruheni/sandbox/tree/master/simple-rest-api) 

As for this folder, I create a simple REST API using `Express`, `Mongoose`, `body-parser` and `Insomnia` to test my API to return simple JSON data on bears. `Mongoose` is used as the Object Relational Mapper(ORM) to create and export the bear model. 

[**5. File Upload**](https://github.com/ruheni/sandbox/tree/master/file-upload)

This folder contains a simple application demonstrating file uploading in JavaScript using `ExpressJs`, 
`Multer` and `body-parser` to submit multi-part files to `uploads/ folder. `Materialize CSS` is also used for 
making a simple UI, buttons and the form-fields for the simple prototype for the upload form.
