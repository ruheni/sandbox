This repository contains files used for learning various programming concepts in the various programming languages I'm learning

**Projects**

**1. Notification**

In this folder, I've explored the `Notification` Browser API used to request the user for permission and sending notifications to the user from a web application or website. They send notifications to the user in the background.

**2. Web-Components** 

I explore how to make `custom HTML elements` in JavaScript and using the `Shadow DOM` and using classes to declare the elements and export them for use on the HTML page.

**3. Simple REST API** 

As for this folder, I create a simple REST API using `Express`, `Mongoose`, `body-parser` and `Insomnia` to test my API to return simple JSON data on bears.
